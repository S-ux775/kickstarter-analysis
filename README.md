# kickstarter-analysis

** Overview of Project
The project is aimed to understand whether or not a fundraising campaing for a play can ba a successful project. The projet has an estimate budget of over $ 10,000 USD. 

** Analysis and Challenges
    For this project, we had access to history of other fundraising campaigns and the outcome of them: whether they were successful or not.

    Available information was sorted, filtered and handled for better use. 

** Results
    Two conclusions are made about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date (2 pt).

    Outcomes based on Goals:
    
    According to charts attached on Resouces file, the success of plays has a strong correlation to its success. In the case of a $ 10,000 USD project, records show a successful rate of over 50%. However, for larger projects (i.e. over $40,000 USD), the result is clearly disappointing.

    As to success of a play based on date, april thru august are good months with peak at may. In all cases, it seems the success does not rely to much on dates when compared to unsuccessful or cancelled plays.

    The dataset set should continously be revised and results updated to better get trends overtime base on budget and play launch dates.
